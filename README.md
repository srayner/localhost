Localhost
=========
A micro site for the home page of my local machine, or local host.

This simply contains;

* Links to my current projects.
* Links to common sites I access
* Google search box.

Ideally I would like to be able to manage the links by listing them in a simple config file,
then maybe later through tools on the home page itself.
